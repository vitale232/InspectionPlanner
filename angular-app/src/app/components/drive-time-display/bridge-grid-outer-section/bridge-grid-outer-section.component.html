<h2> Grid Help Document </h2>
<p>
    Once you dismiss this help document, you'll be greeted by a feature rich grid (or table).
    The grid is intended to provide attribute information about the bridges that are present on the map.
</p>
<h3> What's in the Grid </h3>
<p>
    By default, the grid tabulates the bridges that are appearing on the map. 
    Change the checkbox input below to toggle between all bridges and the map bridges.
</p>
<h3> Sort a Column </h3>
<p>
    All columns are sortable by default. You can simply click a column header, and an arrow appears
    to indicate sort order. An arrow pointing up means the column is sorted "ascending", while an arrow
    pointing down means a column is sorted "descending".
</p>
<p>
    Columns can also be sorted via their context menu. Click the 3 dots icon on the column header, hover over
    the text "Sort", and pick "Ascending" or "Descending".
</p>
<p>
    <strong> Note: </strong> Sometimes the column header text
    obfuscates the 3 dots icon. You can widen the column by double clicking the right side of the header cell
    (like in Excel), or dragging the right side of the column cell to the desired width.
</p>

<h3> Search a Column </h3>
<p>
    Search functionality is accessed via the column context menu, accessed by clicking the 3 dot icon
    in the column header. Searching will look for all cells that contain the input text. For example,
    if you're drive time search includes Saratoga County, NY and Albany County, NY, but you're only,
    interested in the Saratoga County bridges, you can search the county column for "Saratoga". You'll
    be happy to find, the grid will only show Saratoga bridges.

    You can easily hide a column using it's context menu
